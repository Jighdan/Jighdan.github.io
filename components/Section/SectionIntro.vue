					After writing
					<BaseTextLink
						link="https://github.com/Jighdan/MUBI-wbs"
						content="my first Python script"
						:target="true"
					/>, programming became my main curiosity. Since then, I have been
					learning about the different programming languages, paradigms, and
					development processes that it involves.
				</p>
				<p class="intro__text">
					What I have found the most fascinating about programming is how it
					enables you to communicate even with someone that doesn't speak the
					same language; the potential of contribution. ðŸ’ª
				</p>
				<p class="intro__text">
					I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and programming languages,
					interacting with other members from diverse communities, contributing
					to open source, and solving programming challenges. A bit more of my
					skills and projects below! ðŸ”¥
